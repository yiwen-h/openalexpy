# openalexpy
# A Python package to gather bibliographic data from OpenAlex.

For R version: https://github.com/massimoaria/openalexR

The basic idea of openalexpy is to provide three main functions helping the user to:

- Create a query for OpenAlex using specific search criteria, which will be passed into a function
- Send a request to the OpenAlex API to retrieve the results in JSON format
- Transform the JSON into a dataframe or csv for further analysis
